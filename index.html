        <blockquote>
            "No greater force for change exists than the people we surround ourselves with."
            â€” Justin Blaney.

        <p>Starting career with love and passion in the IT industry. Currently am interested to learn more on Machine Learning, Web Development, Mobile Development, and Game Development. Also love filmmaking and editing as a hobby. Driven by commitment to greater outcome whether through collaborating with a team or working on a solo. Being part of a team is good to learn from others, share insights, and contribute to achieving common goals. While working independently gives personal space to dive deep into problems and bring unique vision to life.</p>
